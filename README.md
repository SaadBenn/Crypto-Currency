This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App]

This app is cross compatible and can be run all devices. To run it on a computer, first things first, set up your computer so that it can run RN apps by installing all the development tools. Once you have the development tools, just type 'npm run ios' for iOS or 'npm run android' or to run it on expo, just type 'npm start' and once the QR code shows up, just scan that with your phone.
